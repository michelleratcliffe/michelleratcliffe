Hey, I’m Michelle. 👋

I’m a Junior Frontend Developer with a keen interest in data, UX, AI, Marketing, SEO and all things digital and gaming!

About Me
I have always been involved in something digital and always curious about all aspects of the internet and gaming, constantly trying out new technology, games and hobbies.
Here you'll find my personal coding projects as I build & develop my skills. I am currently obsessed with React and having a great time learning its ins and outs as well as my limitations so I can learn more.
